# MED:Non-Autoregressive Generation-Based Real-Time Production Forecasting with Variable Input Length
Masked Encoding Decoding is designed for production forecasting tasks. It uses a non-autoregressive generation (NAG) method to generate the sequential data. The method allows the dynamic updates of the time-series prediction.
